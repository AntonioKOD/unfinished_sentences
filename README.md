- **✍️ Complete strangers' thoughts** with empathy and creativity

> *"I never got to tell you that..."*

### 🔥 Firebase Setup (Optional)

The app works with demo data out of the box, but for full functionality:

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Create a `.env.local` file with your Firebase config:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

4. Update Firestore security rules for public read/write:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
